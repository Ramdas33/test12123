    "'''Ans:- The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities, problems, or systems in a way that mimics the natural world, making it easier to design, understand, and maintain complex software systems. \n",
    "OOP achieves this goal by organizing code into objects, which are instances of classes representing the entities or concepts in the problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main principles of OOP are:\n",
    "1) Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit called an object.\n",
    "2) Abstraction: Abstraction allows complex systems to be represented at a higher level by defining classes that provide a simplified view of an entity's essential features and behaviors.\n",
    "3) Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (base classes or superclasses).\n",
    "4) Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and generality in code, as the same method can be used to operate on objects of various types, provided they share a common interface.'''"

    "'''In Python, an object is a fundamental concept and a key element of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). \n",
    "An object is an instance of a class and represents a specific entity, data structure, or concept in the program's problem domain. \n",
    "In simpler terms, an object is a self-contained unit that contains both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about objects in Python:\n",
    "1) Class: A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects with specific characteristics. \n",
    "2) Instance: When you create an object based on a class, it is called an instance or an object instance. Each instance is independent of others and has its own unique set of attributes and methods. \n",
    "3) Attributes: Attributes are data members that store information about the object's state. They represent the characteristics or properties of the object. \n",
    "4) Methods: Methods are functions defined within the class that operate on the object's attributes and provide behavior specific to that class. \n",
    "5) Behavior: An object's behavior is determined by its methods. Methods define what an object can do or how it responds to certain actions or events.\n",

    "When a class variable is modified in one instance, the change is reflected in all other instances, as they all share the same class-level variable.\n",
